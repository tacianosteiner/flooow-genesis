# TASK-0152: Live Mercado Livre Order Source Ingestion Slice A

Status: Authorized

Date: 2026-09-06

Governing ADR: ADR-0053

Specification: SPEC-0052

## Objective

Activate the first real read-only Mercado Livre economic-data acquisition after
TASK-0151 while preserving provider source observations below canonical economic
truth.

## Acceptance

TASK-0152 is accepted only when:

- current OAuth envelope is reused, not reparsed independently;
- exactly one bounded seller-order GET occurs per connector read;
- progress is UTC-hour aligned because the provider discards sub-hour date-filter
  precision;
- finishing one source hour never terminally exhausts the live capability;
- caught-up non-closed hours perform no HTTP call and return bounded
  `REMOTE_TEMPORARY`;
- no inline refresh exists;
- provider order/item/payment source values are strict and exact;
- no buyer/seller PII is modeled or persisted;
- no raw provider JSON is persisted;
- no internal `MarketplaceOrderId` is invented;
- no independent economic evidence is written;
- durable source rows and connector progress commit atomically;
- duplicate replay is harmless and conflicting replay fails closed;
- all SPEC-0052 regression gates pass;
- exactly eleven implementation paths change;
- CI/review/merge complete.

## Explicit non-claims

TASK-0152 does not prove:

- complete order history;
- canonical order identity;
- canonical revenue;
- canonical marketplace commission;
- payment settlement;
- seller shipping cost;
- fiscal tax;
- Economic Truth readiness.

## Completion evidence

Implementation evidence is appended here only after code exists and all local
gates pass.
