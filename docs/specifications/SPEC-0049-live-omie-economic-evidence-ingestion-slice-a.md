# SPEC-0049: Live Omie Economic Evidence Ingestion - Slice A

Status: Accepted

Date: 2026-09-06

Governing ADR: ADR-0050

Implementation task: TASK-0149

## Objective

Implement the smallest production-capable, read-only Omie connector slice that
can acquire explicit Omie product-cost data and durably preserve it as
provider-level source observation without inventing marketplace order identity,
currency authority, or canonical economic truth.

Connector Runtime, organization/credential authority, and the existing
marketplace economic evidence contract remain unchanged.

## Capability

Freeze one capability:

```text
marketplace-economic.product-cost
```

Provider key:

```text
omie
```

The capability processes at most one bounded Omie page per Connector Runtime
invocation.

## Credential contract

Slice A uses the existing Integration Control Plane credential custody.

The connector receives opaque credential bytes from Connector Runtime.

Inside the provider module, those bytes decode to a versioned Omie credential
envelope containing exactly:

```text
schemaVersion = 1
appKey
appSecret
```

Rules:

- blank values are invalid;
- values are never included in `toString`, logs, exceptions, telemetry, records,
  progress, or evidence;
- owned temporary byte arrays must be cleared when practical;
- the connector does not persist credentials;
- the connector does not rotate credentials;
- repository source contains no real credential.

## HTTP contract

Use HTTPS only.

Default Omie product endpoint for this slice:

```text
https://app.omie.com.br/api/v1/geral/produtos/
```

Endpoint override is allowed only through explicit constructor/configuration
injection for deterministic tests and controlled environments; it is not
accepted from provider payload or progress.

One invocation performs one provider request/page.

No internal automatic retry loop.

Connector Runtime deadlines, record budget, response-byte budget, and
cancellation remain authoritative.

## Pagination

Progress is opaque to Connector Runtime.

The Omie adapter encodes only the minimum deterministic continuation state
required for the next numbered page.

The adapter validates progress before network use.

Progress must not contain:

- credentials;
- source payload;
- economic amounts;
- organization identity;
- internal order identity.

A page cannot exceed ConnectorBudget.maxRecords.

A response cannot exceed ConnectorBudget.maxResponseBytes.

## Connector record

Define a closed Slice A record representing explicit provider-level product-cost
source evidence.

Minimum fields:

```text
Omie product reference
Omie page/source reference
unit CMC when explicitly present
currency only when explicitly supplied/authorized by the source contract
provider observed/source time when explicitly available
connector observedAt
optional explicit SKU/EAN
```

The record contains no `MarketplaceEconomicEvidenceSubject`.

A connector record is not canonical economic truth.

A record with no valid cost is not converted into zero cost.

Missing currency remains missing.

## Association rule

Slice A performs no Omie-product-to-marketplace-order association.

Title similarity, SKU guessing, product-name matching, price matching, and fuzzy
identity are forbidden.

An exact SKU/EAN/source identity may be retained as source evidence, but it does
not become canonical identity by retention alone.

Historical MGI identity-resolution knowledge may be used later as candidate
evidence, never as implicit canonical association in this slice.

Promotion from provider-level cost to order-level `PRODUCT_COST` is a later
separately governed stage requiring explicit subject, identity, allocation
semantics where applicable, and currency authority.

## Committer and durable progress

Create one PostgreSQL-backed `ConnectorPageCommitter` for this capability.

The provider module owns no durable progress.

The persistence layer may introduce one reusable Postgres connector-progress
store backed by the existing:

```text
integration_connector_progress
integration_connector_page_commit
```

schema.

Slice A also introduces one additive normalized provider-observation table for
Omie product-cost records. It is not an economic-truth or marketplace-evidence
table.

The Omie product-cost committer must:

1. validate organization, capability, and record type;
2. load/use the existing durable connector progress contract;
3. durably write normalized provider-level product-cost records for the page;
4. retain no raw provider response;
5. preserve explicit missing currency rather than invent one;
6. reject conflicting replay for the same page/source identity;
7. advance connector progress only after all normalized records for the page are
   durable;
8. preserve idempotent page replay;
9. never call or mutate the marketplace independent economic evidence repository;
10. never create order-level `PRODUCT_COST` evidence.

The generic Postgres progress store is infrastructure reuse only. It must not
interpret provider records or economic meaning.

## Economic mapping

For an explicit Omie unit CMC, Slice A preserves the exact source decimal as a
provider-level product-cost observation.

Binary floating-point canonicalization is forbidden.

The observation does not claim `EconomicComponentType.PRODUCT_COST`, coverage,
order currency, order quantity allocation, or canonical economic meaning.

Missing/ambiguous values generate no invented amount or currency.

## Deterministic identifiers

Provider-level source observation identity must be deterministic from stable
source/page identity and record ordinal/source reference, or otherwise satisfy
replay idempotency through the durable committer contract.

Repeated delivery of the same provider page must converge without duplicate
source meaning.

A changed provider meaning under an already-committed page/source identity must
fail closed.

Slice A does not invent automatic source correction and does not emit
marketplace economic evidence identifiers.

## Provider failure translation

At minimum:

- invalid/missing credential -> AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED;
- provider authorization denial -> AUTHORIZATION_DENIED;
- HTTP/provider rate limit -> RATE_LIMITED with bounded Retry-After when present;
- provider 5xx/transient transport -> REMOTE_TEMPORARY;
- permanent unsupported request -> REMOTE_PERMANENT;
- malformed economic/provider payload -> REMOTE_DATA_INVALID;
- budget overflow -> BUDGET_EXCEEDED;
- cancellation -> CANCELLED.

No adapter exception, response body, secret, endpoint credential material, or
raw provider payload crosses the public Connector Runtime result boundary.

## Required tests

Module tests must prove at minimum:

- valid credential decoding without secret leakage;
- malformed credential fails before network use;
- HTTPS enforcement;
- one invocation performs at most one page request;
- numbered pagination/progress round trip;
- malformed progress fails before network use;
- record budget enforced;
- response byte budget enforced;
- cancellation before/during work;
- explicit unit_cmc parses exactly;
- absent unit_cmc does not synthesize zero;
- malformed monetary value fails closed;
- missing currency remains missing;
- no fuzzy identity association;
- no marketplace economic subject is invented;
- deterministic replay of the same provider page;
- duplicate provider delivery does not duplicate source meaning;
- conflicting replay blocks progress advancement;
- source-observation persistence failure blocks progress advancement;
- all source-observation durability precedes page progress commit;
- organization isolation;
- connector failure taxonomy mapping;
- secrets absent from public strings/errors;
- raw provider JSON is not persisted.

Existing regression gates must remain green.

## Performance/safety characterization

The test suite must include a representative bounded page near the accepted
record maximum for this capability and prove linear page handling without
unbounded accumulation beyond ConnectorBudget.

No load-test framework or partitioning is authorized.

## Frozen outside Slice A

- PostgreSQL migrations or schema changes other than V019 and the explicitly
  authorized persistence paths;
- Marketplace Economic Evidence domain semantics;
- Economic Truth assembler/calculator;

If implementation requires any frozen path, TASK-0149 stops and governance must
be amended before code continues.
